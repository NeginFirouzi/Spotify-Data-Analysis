# Spotify Data Analysis :headphones: :notes:

During my data science learning journey, I decided to put my new skills into practice in a real-world context by analyzing my music data.

I collected data from my own Spotify playlists and a friend's playlist, diving deep into the realm of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

Here's the process I followed:
## Collecting Data Using the Spotify API

I gathered track information and details from playlists using Spotipy, a library that wraps Spotify's RESTful API.

With Spotipy, I fetched detailed song information, including track name, artist, duration, and audio features. 

Itâ€™s crucial to obtain your client ID and secret from [Spotify Developer's page](https://developer.spotify.com/) prior to using Spotipy. 
You can do this by following the guide at [this helpful link](https://support.heateor.com/get-spotify-client-id-client-secret/).

## Data Analysis and Visualization
After collecting the data, I delved into data analysis and visualization. The insights gained revealed intriguing patterns and comparisons.

## k-Means Clustering via PCA and tSNE-Reduction
The songs obtained above, along with their audio features, provided the basis for my k-Means clustering model. I used both t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the high-dimensional data into a two-dimensional dataset. To visualize my clustering model, I used the Python packages Seaborn and Matplotlib to showcase the distinction of genres.

You can try this yourself to discover what your music says about you!

For more data practices, it might be a good idea to create personal music recommendation systems.
